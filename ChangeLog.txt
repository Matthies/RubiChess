ChangeLog
=========
1.1 (release 201x-xx-xx) :
    - ...

1.0 (release 2018-08-04) :
    - Cleanup: Removed board88 and rotating botboard code
    - Refinement of aspiration window
    - Retuned evaluation parameters based on new test games texeltune-09-bal.pgn and finally texeltune-10.pgn
    - More agressive delta pruning in qsearch
    - Fix: Increase history heuristic value only for cutoff move (not for moves that just raises alpha)
    - Fix: Killer moves where taken from wrong ply
    - Seperated move creation in tactical and quiet moves to gain some speed
    - Code consolitation in rootsearch e.g. lmr

0.9 (release 2018-05-28) :
    - Implemented Syzygy tablebase probing
    - Fixed bug with wrong depth stored in TT after a unreduced research
    - Improved LMR from simple "one depth reduction after move 3" to a reduction depending on depth an move number
    - Fixed quiescience search: Doesn't evaluate patscore when in check
    - Evaluation: Added some king danger via attack units
    - Move order: Moves that escape from null move refutation capture get a higher score
    - Added four more positions for benchmarking as this got too fast

0.8.1 (release 2018-03-24) :
    - Implemented ponder mode (works if ponder move can be read from tt)
    - Implemented / fixed "suddendeath without increment" timecontrol

0.8 (release 2018-03-14) :
    - Fast move after depth 4 for singular root move
    - Extended and reverse futility pruning up to depth 3
    - Added mobility for rook/queen and retuned with fresh games pgn
    - Seperate evaluation for semi- and open file bonus for rooks; excluding the queen now
    - Null move pruning improved: prune even in later game phase and with variable depth reduction
    - Improved tuning: Can create and read fen+moves files now which is 5x faster

0.7 (release 2018-01-19) :
    - Introduced small tempo value for evaluation
    - Implemented MultiPV mode for analysis
    - Fixed bug that writes wrong values of incomplete/interrupted search to hash (responsible(?) for blunder in game 65 of Graham div 9)
    - use additional move buffer in calculation of remeaining time in move/time mode
 
0.7 (release 2018-01-06, Pre-Release for Graham division 9 tournament) :
    - Texel-Tuning!!! Implemented a tuner and tuned all the evaluation parameters which gains about 150 ELO. Thanks to Peter Österlund.
    - Improved search:
        + futility pruning implemented with margin 130
        + delta pruning implemented
        + quiescience search now handles promotion moves
        + fixed bug in SEE (missing pawn attacks) and retuned
    - Total score against 0.6 (4000 games in 10+0.1, 2moves_v1 book): 214.97ELO +/- 11.33
 
0.6 (release 2017-11-26) :
    - Store best move in transposition table even for beta cutoff which is important for move ordering
    - New magic bitboard implementation about 24 % faster than rotating bitboards (still compilable via define)
    - Switched to fail soft environment
    - Fixed a bug where pv move value gets overwritten by killer history value which results in bad move order and sometimes even worse bestmove
    - Simplified/fixed quiescence search (again)
    - Introduced LMR (quite simple right now)
    - Improved sudden death time management again; ELO in 10+0.1 is now almost equal to 40/10
    - Improved evaluation of pawns now using a pawn hash (only used in Bitboard version)

0.5 (release 2017-09-29):
    - Moved undo data from chessmove struct to a static stack which speeds up playing moves
    - More speed by making engine, position, tables global instead of passing them by parameters
    - Better evaluation: Ballanced pawn / minors, diagonal mobility, progress of passed pawns
    - Improved time management, especially sudden death mode
    - Avoids wrong best move from last search when under time pressure
    - Really disabled all the debug code if DEBUG is not defined
    - First Linux release.

0.4 (release 2017-08-04):
    - First rotating bitboard version (choose by #define BITBOARD); 0x88 board still available
    - Use 2^x for transposition size and & instead of % which make accessing the TP a lot faster
    - Some fixes in the pawn evaulation (got different scores for white and black before)
    - Added test for symmetric position evaluation (new parameter - dotests substitutes - hashtest)
    - Fixed timemode "time/inc for whole match"
    - Testrepetition() stops searching at halfmovecounter reset now
    - Search improvement by adding aspiration windows and principal variation search

0.3 (release 2017-06-05) :
    - Now really fixed en passant hashing (code got lost somehow before releasing 0.2.1)
    - New evaluation using phase triggered value tables and some pawn specials
    - Function 'getMoves' now returns pseudo legal moves to avoid time consuming play/unplay
    - Both of these changes leads to speed improvement ~40 % compared to 0.2.1
    - Improved quiscense serach although this might not be the end of story
    - Implemented simple heuristic for insufficient material
    - Improved time management for tournament mode and switched to QueryPerformanceCounter API
    - Fixed memory leaks
    - Removed undotest flag
    - Implemented benchmark mode
    - Some fixes in uci option handling

0.2.1 (release 2017-03-28):
    - Tuned attack detection, move generation, SEE, play/unplay to get more speed out of it; perft shows ~10 % better performance
    - Added history heuristic for move ordering; improvement visible in wacnew/199 where next depth is reached in half time compared to 0.2
    - Implemented 50-moves rule
    - Fixed bug in en passant hashing
    - Fixed bug: ENGINESTOPSOON did not take move of last iteration
    - Improved testengine mode (compare mode, avoid moves, exit flags)

0.2 (release 2017-03-19):
    - Improved use of transposition table which is not reset anymore and can deal with alpha and beta bound entries
    - Alphabeta now uses a quiscence based on SEE evaluation for captures to go
    - Null move pruning added
    - Move ordering now uses killer moves
    - Simplified unplay to just reset the old values stored by play procedure instead of emulating the reverse play
    - Function 'getPositionValue' changed to some simple rules:
        + prefer central fields for knight and bishop
        + prefer open files for rook and queen
        + prefer border positions for king in the beginning to force castles
        + pawns: prefer central pawns, penalty for double pawns, move forward in endgame

0.1 (release 2017-02-24):
    - 0x88 board representation with (hopefully) bugfree move generation and play/unplay
    - Alpha-beta-search implemented with pv move ordering and some 'prefer captures' heuristic
    - Basic implementation of transposition table; not yet very powerfull as it is cannot deal with non-exact values and is reset after every iterative seach
    - getPositionValue: expensive but quite strong position evaluation bases on counting dominated fields
    - Basic UCI protocol implementation so that it can play tournaments in Arena
    - perft implemented
    - testengine mode for bulk testing of EPD files
