    - Null move pruning added
    - Move ordering now uses killer moves
    - Simplified unplay to just reset the old values stored by play procedure instead of emulating the reverse play

        + prefer open files for rook and queen
        + prefer border positions for king in the beginning to force castles
        + pawns: prefer central pawns, penalty for double pawns, move forward in endgame

    - 0x88 board representation with (hopefully) bugfree move generation and play/unplay
    - Alpha-beta-search implemented with pv move ordering and some 'prefer captures' heuristic
    - Basic implementation of transposition table; not yet very powerfull as it is cannot deal with non-exact values and is reset after every iterative seach

    - Basic UCI protocol implementation so that it can play tournaments in Arena
    - perft implemented
    - testengine mode for bulk testing of EPD files
