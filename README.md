# RubiChess
Oh no, just another UCI compliant chess engine. Have a look at the ChangeLog for a detailed feature list.

I don't want to compete with highend engines but to practise programming C++ and to see it improving compared
to earlier releases. I try to avoid simple copy and paste code from other engines, everything needs to "pass
my brain" before it gets implemented.

Many thanks to the excellent documentation at https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/.
Also many thanks to Bluefever and his video tutorial http://bluefever.net/Downloads/ViceReadMe.html
A special thank you goes to open source engine Olithink. I had a look at its source code or even two.
Thank you for the great list of engines at http://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/
Not mentioned all the other documentation and tools freely available.
